TODOs:

1. Make Navigation [function links() in BagelLinks.js]
correspond to output in Column 2 [bagelCol2.js]

Prototyping so far produces this schema (these are not working functions):

Utilizing React Component States


This will go in Row 1, Column 1

const renderValue = x 

function finalRender() {
    return (
        <button onClick = will change renderValue to desired x value>
            Link Label (News for example)
        </button>
    );
};

export default finalRender;

This will go in Column 2

function readFinalRender() {
    return(
        { finalRender() }
    );
};

2. Do Discord API integration for necessary channels for Discord -> Site
auto-push.

This will allow, for example, the Schedule to auto-update whenever Elias
posts the weekly schedule to Discord.

3. Do Static-specific pages along with some other flair for theme

These will not have major Discord API hookups. Instead they will show
Tier Progress, List Static Members (will include Lodestone data. Adventurer Plates
are unavailable for pull--sorry!).

4. Refactor the site for compatibility for all browsers, and different
viewing modes.

Planned breakpoints are (breakpoints as in, what minimum width the screen needs
to be to swap to this mode):

Ultra: 2560px; -in testing
High Resolution: 1920px -in testing
Standard Desktop: 13660px -in testing
Laptop/Tablet: 768px;
Mobile: 360px;

All three desktop resolutions can be tested easily since my monitors match all three.

5. Get the site out of the Som-Dev Container.

This is self-explanatory and will require some CSS work.

Work on getting the actual domain name implemented.

6. Work on a very "special project".
